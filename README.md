Skate
=====

Skate is a CSS-based and jQuery extended slide carrousel / image rotator / whatever-you-call-it.

*Skate is a work in progress!* I'm playing with this in my free time.  While you can probably make use of the work up to this point, you may want to hold off doing anything until this message is gone.

Features to implement:

* Must be responsive.
* Animations for crossfade and slide.
* Controls via touch, mouse (i.e. next and previous buttons, and slide navigation), and keyboard (i.e. with arrow keys)
* Progress-bar-type-thing for current slide duration.
* Classes change to indicate current behavior.
* Custom events.
* Any content can be in a slide.
* Must have great CSS-only fallbacks.
* Transition speed and slide delay settings.
* Selector settings for tweaking default elements.
* Setting to adjust slide container height for dealing with multiple height slides within one deck.
* Setting for autoplay.

Other hopes and dreams:

* Solve the Montevallo problem if possible.
