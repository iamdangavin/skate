Skate
=====

Skate is a CSS-based and jQuery extended slide carrousel / image rotator / whatever-you-call-it.

*Skate is a work in progress!* I'm playing with this in my free time.  While you can probably make use of the work up to this point, you may want to hold off doing anything until this message is gone.

Features:
* Responsive.
* Animations for crossfade, slide, and cards.
* Great CSS-only fallbacks.
* Controls via mouse (i.e. next and previous buttons, and slide navigation).
* Controls via keyboard with left and right arrows. Interaction steals keyboard focus (e.g. hover, click);
* Any content can be in a slide.
* Setting for autoplay.
* Transition speed and slide delay settings applied to both JS animations and CSS transitions.

Features to implement:
* Controls via touch.
* Progress bar for current slide duration.
* Classes change to indicate current behavior.
* Custom events.
* Selector settings for tweaking default elements. (Needs testing; JS Feature)
* Setting to adjust slide container height for dealing with multiple height slides within one deck. (JS Feature)

Other hopes and dreams:
* Solve the Montevallo problem if possible.
* Custom namespaces.
